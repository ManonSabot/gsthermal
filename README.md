# gsthermal

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The package gsthermal models stomatal conductance by maximizing the
instantaneous difference between photosynthetic carbon gain and losses
associated with hydraulic failure and thermal damage. This optimization
model is based on the profit maximization approach of Sperry et
al. (2016) but is distinguished by its inclusion of the cost of thermal
damage, which the Sperry et al. model does not account for.

## Installation

You can install the development version of gsthermal from
[GitHub](https://github.com/CamilleSicangco/gsthermal) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("CamilleSicangco/gsthermal")
```
